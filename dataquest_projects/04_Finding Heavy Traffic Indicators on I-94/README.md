# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects. Each project explores a different dataset and applies various data science techniques, from exploratory data analysis and visualization to machine learning modeling.

## Projects

### 1. I-94 Interstate Highway Traffic Analysis

*   **Notebook:** `Documentos/albertjimrod/data-projects/02_Data_Analisis_Visualization/01_Data Visualization Fundamentals/Traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway.ipynb`

*   **Description:** This project performs an in-depth exploratory analysis of a dataset containing westbound traffic volume on the I-94 Interstate highway. The goal is to identify key indicators of heavy traffic by analyzing patterns related to the time of day, day of the week, month, and weather conditions.

*   **Key Techniques:**
    *   Data cleaning and preparation with Pandas.
    *   Time series analysis by splitting data into daytime/nighttime and weekday/weekend.
    *   Data visualization with Matplotlib to identify trends and correlations.
    *   Grouping and aggregation to find hourly, daily, and monthly traffic patterns.

### 2. Car Price Prediction

*   **Notebook:** `Documentos/albertjimrod/Data-science-projects/07_ML_I/Predicting Car Prices/7-1-6-Predicting_cars_price_end_first_part.ipynb`

*   **Description:** This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the price of cars based on their features. It involves a comprehensive data cleaning process, feature engineering, and data normalization before applying a predictive model.

*   **Key Techniques:**
    *   Data cleaning: Handling missing values (e.g., `?`) and converting data types.
    *   Feature Engineering: Converting categorical features to numerical, and performing unit conversions (e.g., `highway-mpg` to `L/100km`).
    *   Data Normalization: Scaling numerical features to a standard range for modeling.
    *   Supervised Machine Learning (Regression).
