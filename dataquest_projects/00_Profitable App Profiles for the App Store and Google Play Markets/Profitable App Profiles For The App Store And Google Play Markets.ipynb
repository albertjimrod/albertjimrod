    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Working for a company that **only build free apps to download and install** available on Google Play and in the App Store, our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app therefore the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. \n",

    "**Introduction to the Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's mobile development landscape, it is crucial to understand which types of applications attract more users in both Android and Apple ecosystems. With the goal of providing valuable information to developers, this project focuses on data analysis to identify common characteristics among the applications that receive a higher number of downloads and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What Does the Project Entail?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This data analysis combines information from various sources, such as Google Play Store and iTunes App Store, along with usage and performance metrics. Using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, patterns and trends are identified to indicate which types of applications perform better in each platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Project Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The primary objective of this project is to provide developers with precise information about the characteristics that resonate best with users on Android and iOS. By understanding better what types of applications perform well in terms of downloads, engagement, and retention, developers can make more informed decisions for the design and optimization of their own apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is collect and analyze data from each of the online stores to understand what type of apps it would be interesting to develop to attract more users.\n",

    "### Contextual Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "When we analyze a dataset of applications, it's common to find some applications listed multiple times. To address this, we need to determine the best criteria to remove these duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Observation:\n",
    "Once we have verified that there are many applications (some repeated more than once), we need to decide how to handle the duplicates. Specifically, we want to retain only those versions of an application that have the most recent and relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criterion for Removing Duplicates:\n",
    "The criterion chosen is: \"The higher the number of reviews, the more recent the data should be!\" \n",
    "Instead of randomly removing duplicate entries, we will keep only those applications that are repeated and have the highest number of reviews. The versions with fewer reviews will be eliminated in favor of those with more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function to Create a Dictionary:\n",
    "To implement this criterion, we use a function that processes a dataset (usually a list of lists) and creates a dictionary where:\n",
    "- **Key:** The name of the app.\n",
    "- **Value:** The maximum number of reviews associated with that app.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that for each application, we keep only the version with the highest review count. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating the Dictionary `reviews_max`:\n",
    "We create a dictionary called `reviews_max`, where:\n",
    "- The key is the name of the application.\n",
    "- The value is the number of reviews for that application (extracted from the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "To populate this dictionary, we follow these steps:\n",
    "1. **Extracting Data**: We extract the `name` and `n_reviews` (the number of reviews) for each application.\n",
    "2. **Updating or Adding to the Dictionary**:\n",
    "   - If a name already exists in the dictionary and the value associated with that key is less than the current `n_reviews`, we update the value.\n",
    "   - If a name does not exist in the dictionary, we add it along with its corresponding `n_reviews`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that our final dictionary contains only the most reviewed versions of each application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have the following data for three applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- App A: 10 reviews\n",
    "- App B: 20 reviews (repeated twice)\n",
    "- App C: 5 reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "After processing, our `reviews_max` dictionary would look like this:\n",
    "- Key: \"App A\", Value: 10 reviews\n",
    "- Key: \"App B\", Value: 20 reviews\n",
    "- Key: \"App C\", Value: 5 reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for each application, we keep the version with the highest number of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "By using this approach, we ensure that our dataset contains only the most relevant and reviewed versions of each application, making it more accurate and useful."
