## About this project:

The strategy implemented in the document to find profitable app profiles for the App Store and Google Play markets can be summarized into the following structured steps:

### 1. **Objective Definition**
   - The primary goal is to identify app profiles that are likely to attract more users and generate revenue through in-app ads.
   - The analysis focuses on free apps, as the company's revenue depends on user engagement with ads.

---

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - Two datasets were selected for analysis:
     - **Google Play** dataset with approximately 10,000 apps.
     - **App Store** dataset with around 7,000 apps.
   - The datasets were obtained from external sources like Kaggle.

---

### 3. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
   - Initial exploration of the datasets was conducted to understand their structure and identify useful columns.
   - Several cleaning tasks were performed:
     - **Error Removal**: For instance, the Google Play dataset had a row with a rating of 19 (out of a max 5), which was deleted.
     - **Duplicate Removal**: Apps with multiple entries were filtered, retaining the entry with the highest number of reviews to ensure data reliability.
     - **Filtering for English Apps**: Non-English apps were removed using a function that checks for the presence of non-ASCII characters.
     - **Filtering for Free Apps**: Only free apps were retained for the analysis.

---

### 4. **Frequency Analysis**
   - **App Store**: The most common genres were analyzed using the `prime_genre` column. It was observed that games dominated the market, followed by entertainment and photo & video apps.
   - **Google Play**: The `Category` and `Genres` columns were analyzed. Family-oriented and tool apps were found to dominate, though the family category largely consisted of childrenâ€™s games.

---

### 5. **Popularity Analysis**
   - **App Store**: Since install data is unavailable, the total number of user ratings was used as a proxy for popularity. Genres like social networking, navigation, and reference apps had the highest average user ratings, though the averages were often skewed by a few highly popular apps (e.g., Facebook, Waze, Bible).
   - **Google Play**: Install numbers provided a direct measure of popularity. However, these values were categorized (e.g., "1,000+", "10,000+") rather than precise, requiring adjustments for analysis.

---

### 6. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - **App Store**:
     - Practical apps (e.g., reference apps) could stand out in a market dominated by entertainment apps.
     - Developing an app with practical utility (e.g., a book app with additional features) might have strong potential.
   - **Google Play**:
     - The platform supports a more balanced mix of practical and fun apps, suggesting opportunities for diverse app profiles.
     - Categories like tools and family-oriented apps may offer significant potential due to their high representation.

---

### 7. **Validation Strategy**
   - A three-step validation approach was proposed:
     1. Launch a minimal viable product (MVP) on Google Play.
     2. Enhance the app based on user feedback.
     3. If successful, release an iOS version.

This structured strategy ensures a data-driven approach to identifying promising app profiles while minimizing risks and development costs.


In the document, both built-in system functions and user-defined functions have been used to perform tasks such as cleaning, exploring, and analyzing the data. Below is a detailed explanation of these functions, their origin (system or user-defined), and their role in the workflow:
