    "In today's mobile development landscape, it is crucial to understand which types of applications attract more users in both Android and Apple ecosystems. With the goal of providing valuable information to developers, this project focuses on data analysis to identify common characteristics among the applications that receive a higher number of downloads and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What Does the Project Entail?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This data analysis combines information from various sources, such as Google Play Store and iTunes App Store, along with usage and performance metrics. Using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, patterns and trends are identified to indicate which types of applications perform better in each platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Project Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The primary objective of this project is to provide developers with precise information about the characteristics that resonate best with users on Android and iOS. By understanding better what types of applications perform well in terms of downloads, engagement, and retention, developers can make more informed decisions for the design and optimization of their own apps.\n",
    "\n",

    "The first is the collection and analysis of data on mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store.

    "1. **General Objective**: Our company develops applications in English and we are interested in analyzing only those applications aimed at an English-speaking audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identified Problem**: Upon examining the data, we have found that some application names suggest they are not intended for an English-speaking audience. This is often due to the presence of symbols or characters that are not commonly used in English text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Proposed Strategy**: To address this problem, we will remove all applications whose names contain symbols that are not typically used in English. These symbols include letters from other alphabets, punctuation marks (., !, ?, ;), and other non-alphabetic characters such as (+, *, /).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Detailed Method**:\n",
    "   - Each character (letter, number, dot, comma, etc.) has a corresponding number that can be obtained using the built-in function `ord()`.\n",
    "   - For example, the character \"a\" corresponds to 97, \"A\" corresponds to 65, and any other non-alphabetic character might have a different value (for instance, \"爱\" is 29.233).\n",
    "   - We will use the `ord()` function to get the numerical value of each character in a string.\n",
    "   - If a character has a number that falls outside the common range for English characters (i.e., not within the range 65-90 for uppercase and 97-122 for lowercase), we will remove that application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our strategy is:\n",
    "- Use `ord()` to get the numerical value of each character in the names of the applications.\n",
    "- Compare this value with the common range of values for English characters (65-90 for uppercase and 97-122 for lowercase).\n",
    "- Remove any applications whose names contain at least one character outside this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy will ensure that we only analyze applications with names clearly in English.\n",

    "We use English for the applications we develop in our company, and we would like to analyze only applications aimed at an English-speaking audience. \n",
