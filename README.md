My name is [Alberto Jimenez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-jimenez-8a8559222/), I studied electronics to understand the workings of electronic musical instruments and the inner of sound design. 

I was working in different electronics and audiovisual companies as a technician, and also as a freelance sound designer for a company online called [Gameprefabs today **Unity Asset Store**](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/2954), and as an [electronic music composer profile](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466106/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) for a couple of movies while I discover Linux, [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and the Open software community.

Finally, [I built my synth](https://midimachines.wordpress.com/), the synthesizer which I went into electronics! and somehow it close the cycle of electronics and technician stuff, so I needed to update myself, and improve professionally, so I did it by studying for a [Master's degree in Business Intelligence and Big Data](https://accounts.iebschool.com/mi-diploma/abaa0886b52591b851a33c17b4653f20/) online. 

I decided to extract the maximum benefit from the time I was studying for my master's so *with a fair knowledge of programming Python*, but with a **very great need to have the content of the videos transcribed**, I had to create a very simple tool to be able to make the transcriptions of the Vimeo videos and have all the text in the video lessons, i called: [Sonus transcriber](https://github.com/albertjimrod/personal_projects/blob/main/Sonus_transcribere/sonus%20transcriber.md)

Suddenly a new world of possibilities opened up in front of me, so I decided to apply my new knowledge in a field that was already known to me and, I did it in [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) in my master's thesis.

Since then I continue to train in the field of data analysis and machine learning.
