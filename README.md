**A bit about me**:

Hello! I‚Äôm Alberto Jim√©nez.üëã

My journey in this field began in 2019 when I decided to change my professional path as electronics and pursued the [Master‚Äôs in Business Intelligence and Data Science](https://accounts.iebschool.com/mi-diploma/abaa0886b52591b851a33c17b4653f20/) at [IEBS](https://www.iebschool.com/). School of Business Innovation and Entrepreneurs. 

During that period, I immersed myself completely in my studies, convinced that [my final master‚Äôs project](https://datablogcafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Clasificacion_frecuencial-2.pdf) should fully reflect the knowledge gained, both technically and conceptually.

From that moment on, I focused on improving my technical skills within this exciting field, working on the projects that you can see here are the result of having worked in [dataquest.io](dataquest.io) and also obtained the [Google Data Analytics certificate](https://coursera.org/share/e330e85b9a469d87b9f8729bb552f095).


Apart from the projects presented here, you would like to see notes on a particular topic or personal reflections on this or that thing, I have a blog that I use mainly personally as a notebook, here is the link I would love you to visit it [https://datablogcafe.com/](https://datablogcafe.com/).

You're more than welcome.ü§ù

A.
