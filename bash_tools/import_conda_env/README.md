# 🧠 Conda Environment Installer from YAML Files

This Bash script automates the process of **installing multiple Conda environments** from `.yaml` configuration files. It is a useful tool for restoring or replicating environments across machines using exported environment definitions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Searches for all `.yaml` files** in a specified directory
- ✅ **Installs each Conda environment** defined in the YAML files
- ✅ **Displays progress and success/error messages**
- ✅ **Easy to integrate into setup or recovery workflows**

---

## 🧰 How It Works

1. Checks if the specified YAML directory exists
2. Looks for `.yaml` files in that directory
3. Iterates through each file and creates a Conda environment using its name as the environment name
4. Reports whether each environment was created successfully or if there were errors

---

## 📋 Requirements

Before using this script, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Bash shell** (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)
- ✅ **Conda** installed and working
- ✅ Valid `.yaml` files generated by `conda env export`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

At the top of the script, you can customize the following variable:

```bash
DIRECTORIO_YAML="./"  # Change this to the path where your .yaml files are stored
```

### Example:
```bash
DIRECTORIO_YAML="/home/user/conda_envs_yaml/"
```

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x install_conda_envs.sh

# Run the script
./install_conda_envs.sh
```

---

## 📂 Sample Output

```
Buscando archivos .yaml en ./
Instalando el entorno myenv1 desde ./myenv1.yaml...
Entorno myenv1 instalado correctamente.
Instalando el entorno myenv2 desde ./myenv2.yaml...
Entorno myenv2 instalado correctamente.
Proceso de instalación de entornos completado.
```

## 🛠️ Tips & Notes

- This script assumes that the YAML filenames match the desired environment names.
- If an environment already exists, `conda env create` will fail. You may want to use `conda env update --prefix` instead if updating existing environments.
- Always verify that the YAML files are compatible with your current system (especially when moving between platforms).

## 💡 Want to Improve This?

You could enhance the script by adding:

- [ ] ✅ Option to update existing environments
- [ ] 🧹 Automatically move or delete YAML files after installation
- [ ] 🔍 Recursive search in subdirectories
- [ ] 📁 Create a log file for tracking results
